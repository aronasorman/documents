<br><b class="center">SAME-SEX RAPE OF MALE COLLEGE STUDENTS </b><br>
<p class="body-paragraph"><strong> Abstract. </strong> Rape of men by
other men is a widely neglected yet increasingly recognized form of
sexual assault. Information on same-sex rape involving men is
frequently absent in campus rape education and prevention programming
because the general public and popular culture have traditionally
viewed rape in a context of violence against women. Available medical
and psychological literature indicates the need for expanded
prevention, treatment, and research dealing with men who rape other
men. Several initiatives in the areas of curriculum infusion, support,
services, training, and public policy for addressing same-sex rape of
men in campus communities are offered. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph"><strong> Key Words: </strong> college men, rape, sexual assault, students, violence </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">An estimated 5% to 10% of rapes committed in the United States involve male victims.(<a name="bib1up"> </a><a href="#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1" title="n1-n3">n1-n3</a>)
The Bureau of Justice's National Crime Victimization Survey found that,
of the rapes reported to the survey in 1994, the most recent year for
which data are available, 5% of rape victims aged 12 years and older
were males.(<a name="bib4up"> </a><a href="#bib4" id="ref_linkbib4" title="n4">n4</a>)
These and similar data necessarily reflect only an estimation of the
rape of men in the United States because of the vast underreporting of
rape in general and the fact that fewer men than women seem willing to
report being raped.(<a name="bib3up"> </a><a href="#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3" title="n3">n3</a>,<a name="bib5up"> </a><a href="#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5" title="n5">n5</a>,<a name="bib6up"> </a><a href="#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6" title="n6">n6</a>) </p>

<a name="AN9703270004-3"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a href="#toc" id="hd_toc_13" title="Defining the Term ">Defining the Term </a></span>
<p class="body-paragraph">The term male rape is frequently used in
reference to the same-sex rape of men. Unless carefully defined, the
term may be semantically confusing because many people remain unsure
whether the male in male rape is an indicator of the rapist, the
victim, or both. The use of homosexual rape to connote men raping men
is also problematic. The (homo)sexual terminology perpetuates the
stereotypical notions that all gay men are sexual predators or that
only gay men rape other men. On the contrary, the majority of men who
rape other men are identified as heterosexual.(<a name="bib5up"> </a><a href="#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5" title="n5">n5</a>,<a name="bib7up"> </a><a href="#bib7" id="ref_linkbib7" title="n7-n9">n7-n9</a>) </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Emphasis on the root word sex in homosexual
rape also conflates consensual sex with rape behavior. Fortunately,
feminist social movements since the 1970s have laid much of the
groundwork for an understanding of rape as an act of power rather than
sex. Until now, most research on male rape has concluded, as has
research on opposite-sex rape, that the rape of men is not sexually
motivated.(<a name="bib5up"> </a><a href="#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5" title="n5-n9">n5-n9</a>)
Instead, it is a form of violent power and control exercised over
others. Although opposite-sex rape can be seen as a violent expression
of power related to gender inequality, same-sex rape can involve other
power dynamics related to physical strength, weapon use, influence of
alcohol and other drugs, political strength, economic power, social
power, and more. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">One attempt to delineate the different kinds
of male rape involves an examination of the sexual identity of both the
rapist and the survivor. Viewing same-sex rape as an act of power
through this lens is especially poignant, considering the controversy
surrounding the dichotomization of rape and sex employed by feminist
movements of the last 25 years. For example, the rape of gay men (or
men perceived to be gay) by heterosexual men is often accompanied by
misogynist verbal epithets in which the rapist degrades his victim with
such language as "bitch," "girl," and so on.(<a name="bib5up"> </a><a href="#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5" title="n5">n5</a>,<a name="bib8up"> </a><a href="#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8" title="n8">n8</a>,<a name="bib10up"> </a><a href="#bib10" id="ref_linkbib10" title="n10">n10</a>) </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">When same-sex rape is employed as a hate
crime against gay men, usually as part of gay-bashing, social
inequality between heterosexual and gay men is clear evidence of a
propensity to commit acts of violence. Rigidly traditional forms of
hegemonic masculinity portray gay men as weak, feminine, and fit only
for punishment and humiliation in the most dehumanizing way possible.
"The victim may symbolize what they [the rapists] want to control,
punish, and/or destroy, something they want to conquer and defeat. The
assault is an act of retaliation, an expression of power, and an
assertion of their strength and manhood."(n5(809)) Sexual violence
within gay male relationships or between gay male acquaintances is also
a serious problem, just as it is for heterosexual people and lesbian
women.(<a name="bib11up"> </a><a href="#bib11" id="ref_linkbib11" title="n11-n13">n11-n13</a>) </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Same-sex rape of heterosexual men carries the
stigma and shame associated with homosexuality in our culture; if the
general population equates sex and rape to some degree, a man who has
been raped by another man is, by implication, a homosexual. The above
categories could be further differentiated on the basis of whether the
assault was stranger or acquaintance rape, interracial or intraracial,
familial or nonfamilial, involved individual or multiple assailants,
and so on. All of these factors can influence the rape experience, the
dynamics of power involved, and the devastating aftermath faced by the
male survivor. </p>

<a name="AN9703270004-4"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a href="#toc" id="hd_toc_25" title="Denial of the Significance of Male Rape ">Denial of the Significance of Male Rape </a></span>
<p class="body-paragraph">Discussions of adult male rape are frequently
absent in campus rape education and prevention programs because the
general public and popular culture have traditionally viewed rape in a
context of violence against women. Although women statistically
constitute the majority of rape victims, assessments in medicine, law,
and education continue to deny, dismiss, or diminish the significant
number of men who are sexually assaulted.(<a name="bib14up"> </a><a href="#bib14" id="ref_linkbib14" title="n14">n14</a>)
Male survivors of sexual assault may be less likely to report or seek
treatment for their assault, in part because these men view rape crisis
centers and hotlines as having been established to serve only women.(<a name="bib2up"> </a><a href="#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2" title="n2">n2</a>,<a name="bib6up"> </a><a href="#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6" title="n6">n6</a>) </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">At many colleges and universities, the rape
of men by other men has only recently begun to generate responses from
campus communities. Many sexual assault programs and organizations
across the country are implementing minor initiatives to include and
accommodate males in rape-related work, but the growing pains of such
developments quickly become apparent. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">A primary example is the dilemma of college
rape education and prevention programs, often housed within campus
women's centers and organizations that provide services and funding to
male survivors. Many of these programs have mission statements that
define their priority as the improvement of the campus climate for
women while empowering them to overcome obstacles of sexism. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Is it then appropriate for these
organizations to use resources that have been allocated for women's
benefit to acts of violence that occur against and between men? If not,
then where should such services originate and who should be held
responsible for primary and secondary male rape prevention programs?
How can we change existing systems to confront and deal with the
phenomenon of male rape without compromising or damaging the successful
sexual assault education and prevention services we have fought so hard
to develop? Even an acknowledgment that men can be victims (or
perpetrators) of same-sex rape may introduce a gender-contradiction
into the women-centered missions, objectives, and goals of some sexual
assault prevention programs, disrupting the fundamental structure and
philosophy upon which they may have been built. </p>

<a name="AN9703270004-5"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a href="#toc" id="hd_toc_35" title="Recommendations ">Recommendations </a></span>
<p class="body-paragraph">Concrete suggestions for the infusion of male
rape programmatic content and services into general prevention
education and crisis services are numerous. Here are six areas that
campus health professionals should consider in evaluating how prepared
they are to meet the needs of male rape survivors. </p>

<a name="AN9703270004-6"> </a><h4>Prepare Resources and Referrals for Male Survivors  </h4>
<p class="body-paragraph">Are campus sexual assault centers prepared
for male survivors' needs? Adequate referrals for support groups,
counselors, hotlines, medical attention, financial assistance, and
academic support should be prepared. Male-specific or gender-neutral
literature and a short reading list should be available to the
survivor. These resources should be compiled before a survivor contacts
the office, not as the result of a last-minute search on behalf of a
survivor in need of immediate crisis assistance. </p>

<a name="AN9703270004-7"> </a><h4>Provide Training to Campus Health Clinic and Emergency Room Staff  </h4>
<p class="body-paragraph">Are campus health clinics and local hospital
emergency rooms trained in the care of adult male survivors of rape?
Many rape advocates and medical professionals never receive any such
formal training. Not all hospital and statewide protocols for the
forensic collection of evidence in rape cases include male-specific
content. Adequate training for examination of men's bodies is crucial,
as are procedures for the identification and interpretation of physical
findings. </p>

<a name="AN9703270004-8"> </a><h4>Determine and Address the Legal Implications of Same-Sex Rape  </h4>
<p class="body-paragraph">Do law enforcement officials receive sexual
assault sensitivity training? If so, is the occurrence of male rape
addressed? State and local legal statutes may strongly influence the
campus climate for male rape survivors. How is male-on-male rape
defined by state and local laws? In many states, rape laws are gender
specific, rendering the rape of men a legal impossibility. </p>

<a name="AN9703270004-9"> </a><h4>Ensure That Campus Policies Apply to Same-Sex Sexual Violence  </h4>
<p class="body-paragraph">Do campus policies relating to rape and
sexual harassment, codes of student conduct, and nondiscrimination
policies allow for the possibility of same-sex sexual violence? </p>

<a name="AN9703270004-10"> </a><h4>Conduct Prevention and Education Work in Addition to Treatment  </h4>
<p class="body-paragraph">Is any form of proactive education and
prevention work being done on campus? Reacting to the rape of men is
essential, but it is not enough. Absence of attention to male rape
denies the reality of same-sex rape and subsequently renders male
survivors invisible. Infusion of male rape content into general rape
education programming can be effective, not only for the provision of
information but also for signifying that the organization or office is
receptive and prepared to work with male survivors. Even a basic
informational handout can be effective in heightening awareness that
rape of men happens in campus communities. not solely in prison
populations (see sidebar). </p>

<a name="AN9703270004-11"> </a><h4>Provide Culturally Competent Programs  </h4>
<p class="body-paragraph">Has population-specific awareness and
programming been considered? When the entire college rape prevention
programming is based on heterosexual models, the sexual assault of gay
men, as part of gay-bashing or acquaintance rape, is overlooked. Race,
class, and other socioeconomic factors could influence the assault
characteristics and impact. Single-sex campus environments, such as
athletic teams, ROTC, all-male residence halls, and fraternities, may
also be at a higher risk for male rapes, given the hierarchical
structure such environments tend to rely on and the internal power
struggles that often manifest as physical violence.(<a name="bib8up"> </a><a href="#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8" title="n8-n10">n8-n10</a>) Outreach to these communities is essential. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">The suggestions outlined above are not
all-inclusive. The diversity of higher education institutions will
dictate the development of additional programs and differing approaches
to meet the particular needs of students. More extensive research on
the same-sex rape of men is needed to draw further conclusions and
closer estimations of this form of violence. As the knowledge and
visibility of male rape increases nationally, so will the call for
expertise in prevention, education, and treatment related to same-sex
rape in campus communities. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Myth: Men cannot be raped. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Fact: Any person can be sexually assaulted.
Although some state laws define the rape of men as sodomy or some other
category of criminal activity. the reality of the crime and intensity
of its impact make sexual assault one of the most devastating acts of
violence a man can experience. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Myth: The rape of men happens only in prison. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Fact: Those who claim that rape of men
happens only in institutional settings contribute to the continuing
denial of rape in every community. Sexual assault can occur at any time
in any place. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Myth: Only homosexual men rape other men. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Fact: The overwhelming majority of men who
rape other men identify themselves as heterosexual. Rape is an act of
violence and power. not an act of sex. Rapists seek to dominate and
humiliate their victims.(<a name="bib1up"> </a><a href="#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1" title="n1">n1</a>) </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Myth: The only males who are raped are children or very weak adults. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Fact: Any male, regardless of his age. class, race. physical strength, or sexual identity can be raped. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Myth: If a man experiences an erection or ejaculation while being raped, it means he wants to be raped. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Fact: Some men may experience an erection or
ejaculation while being raped, not as the result of pleasure or an
expression of consent, but as an involuntary physiological response to
intense tear. pain, or anxiety. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Myth: Very few men, if any, are ever raped. </p>

<p class="body-paragraph">Fact: Until very recently, male rape remained
a hidden crime. Like the rape of women and domestic violence, its
incidence was considered low or nonexistent because most cases went
unreported. Evidence now exists that demonstrates that male rape is
both a frequent and serious occurrence. Several studies estimate that
of the total number of rapes 5% to 10% involve male victims.(<a name="bib2up"> </a><a href="#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2" title="n2">n2</a>,<a name="bib3up"> </a><a href="#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3" title="n3">n3</a>)
Other organizations, such as San Francisco's Bay Area Women Against
