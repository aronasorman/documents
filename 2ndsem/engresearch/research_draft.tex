\tab Rape has been a pressing issue globally. According to the latest figures of the National Statistics Office we had 1,267 reported rape cases last 2008 or an average of almost 4 rape cases per day (21). But according to Graham male rape is still a predominantly female issue; he states that the public only recognizes females as the victims of rape and disregards males, which results in the lack of statistics and general information on male rape (2).

It is important at this point to define some terms that will be used to avoid confusion. \textit{Rape} in context of this paper is the forced attempt at sexual gratification by a perpetrator to an unwilling victim. \textit{Male rape} therefore is rape wherein the intended victim is either a homosexual or heterosexual male. People often stereotype homosexual men, thinking that most of them like the idea of male-on-male sex and would thus consent or even pursue such acts. But according to the findings of Burgess it is often heterosexual men who commit male rape (qtd. from Scarce).
