\subsubsection{Male rape is real}

\tab Rape has been a pressing issue globally. According to the latest figures of the Philippine Government's National Statistics Office we had 1,267 reported rape cases from the year 2008 alone or an average of almost 4 rape cases per day (21). But according to Graham male rape is still a predominantly female issue; he states that the public only recognizes females as the victims of rape and disregards males, which results in the lack of statistics and general information on male rape specifically (2).

It is important at an early point to define some terms that will be used to avoid confusion. \textit{Rape} in context of this paper is the forced attempt at sexual gratification by a perpetrator to an unwilling victim. \textit{Male rape} therefore is rape wherein the intended victim is a male. It is important to emphasize that homosexual males can  be raped using the definition given. People often stereotype homosexual men, thinking that most of them entertain the idea of male-on-male sex and would thus consent or even pursue such acts. But according to the findings of Burgess it is often heterosexual men who commit male rape (qtd. from Scarce par. 1).

One could thus ask why so many heterosexual males would want to rape other males. Scarce pointed out that male rape would be better understood if seen as an act of power instead of sexual gratification (par. 5). He cites one example in US prisons wherein males who are ``At the top of the pack'' would rape other males, preferably known homosexuals and would call them derogatory names like ``bitch'' and ``girl.'' Schwartz and DeKeseredy expound on this view by saying that people are raised in a patriarchy, or specifically a \textit{societal patriarchy}, a society which among other things emphasizes on male superiority and domination against females and other males (61-74). This type of society they say, turns males into rapists by teaching them to objectify both their fellow males and females and treating them as simply commodities and subhumans which must be beaten down if seen as superior to themselves. This society also places emphasis on a male's ego as a driving force for his actions. Rape therefore can be seen as the ultimate device for male dominance and for ``bringing people down to their right place.'' It boosts the ego of the male perpetrator while severely degrading the male victim's. According to Sable et al. due to this degraded ego male victims lose the courage to file a complaint and would rather not report to the police at all, or if they would, report it to a female police officer instead of another male for fear of ``admitting to a guy\ldots how much they failed as a man'' (497). This would support the survey conducted by Walker et al. wherein out of the 40 male rape victims interviewed only 5 have ever reported to the police (qtd. from Davies 534).
